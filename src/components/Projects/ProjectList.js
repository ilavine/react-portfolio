      "An application that allows the user to select a random drink recipe as well as a random joke and save them to tell a friend. The purpose of this project was to create an interactive application using two server-side APIs, a CSS framework other than bootstrap, and local storage. This involved working collaboratively to implement Official_Joke_Api and The_Cocktail_DB on a webpage styled using Bulma that updates dynamically. The implementation included giving users the ability to generate and save their favorite jokes and drinks to local storage.",
